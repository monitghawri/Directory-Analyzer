The Directory Analyzer is a Java application that analyzes the contents of a directory and generates an XML hierarchy representing the folders and files within it.

## Overview

The Directory Analyzer recursively traverses the specified directory, counting the number of folders and files it contains. It then generates an XML file (`directory_hierarchy.xml`) that represents the hierarchical structure of the directory, including all subfolders and files.
